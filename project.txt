If you are involved in a fender bender or any other type of collision (real or metaphorical), avoid taking it personally. Things happen, and every time you can let the stress roll off of your back, you grow and learn. Of course, if you are in a situation where you know someone is working against you, you should feel free to unsheath your claws.")
elif s==2:
    print("The art of flirtation takes a lot of time to learn, but you are becoming quite an expert. It's time to stop holding back and start using those killer skills you have learned! If you have someone in your sights, romantically speaking, today is the day to make that connection. Ask a pertinent question or two and help them see you in a new light. If you are currently in a relationship, get ready for things to go to a much hotter level.")
elif s==3:
    print("You need to know where to go for the information that will help you most in life. Instead of asking friends for advice on how to fatten up your rapidly thinning piggy bank, ask an expert. Friends are who you should talk to about your love life, work hassles, and other personal issues. But when it comes to credit, investments, and your savings account, you don't want to mix those two worlds. Sharing too much about how much money you make or have could also create unnecessary friction.")

There are an awful lot of small details that could grow into big, embarrassing issues later on down the line if you don't nip them in the bud now. Probably the last thing you want to do is proofread or double-check your work one more time, but you should do it. It will save you a lot more of your time (and your pride) in the long run.")

You are not overly impulsive as a rule, but today you should behave even more conservatively than usual. Bide your time and the right opportunity to have a blast will present itself soon enough. Skip any splurges and stay close to home. You can have just as celebratory a time cuddled up with a good book or your partner as you can at a big party.")

Your fears are starting to vanish and your courage is growing, in part because your mind is hungry for new stimulation—even if that stimulation is based on fear! You will be totally fiery and full of energy, so put it to good use by pushing the envelope and pushing past one or two of the boundaries you've built for yourself.")

Stop trying to nail down every single detail. You can't eliminate every potential problem. It's time to start acting! Things are never going to be perfect, so if you're waiting until they are, you will be waiting a very long time—too long, in fact. You need to keep moving even if you don't know exactly where you're going.")

As soon as you feel that someone is rubbing you the wrong way, distance yourself from them. You aren't in the right frame of mind to deal with feeding people's egos or sacrificing your own desires. What you need now is to be surrounded by people who get you, the people who use the same shorthand you use.")

Just a little bit of effort will wake you up to the reality of your situation and make you much more grateful for what you have.")

What are they up to!? If you look beneath the surface, you will start to see a pattern and an agenda. This is something exciting, and you should not ignore it. Try to get involved in their shenanigans and you will have a lot of fun. They could use a bright, witty person like you!")

Let them know you're thinking about them and be honest about how you feel. Let down your guard and speak from the heart.")
